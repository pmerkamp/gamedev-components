# gamedev-components

Hopefully will be able to build a complete game out of these eventually.
All code should be reasonably clean so treading through it isn't a sad experience.

### currently included projects:
- **dialogue**: a Unity dialogue demo using the Ink scripting language. portrait and background assets created using artbreeder.com, ui created by me
- **dungeon-gen**: an implementation of a parameterized random dungeon generator - essentially a linked list where each node has a north, east, south, and west linkage, rather than a left and right linkage. the root room sprouts four branches which can intersect. game is 2D but dungeon system could easily be adapted to 3D. all assets created by me.

### planned projects:
- **action**: a fun live combat system
- **turnbased**: a fun turn-based combat system
- **puzzle**: a fun puzzle system
- **inventory**: a satisfying inventory system
	- also shop
- **multiplayer**: dead simple multiplayer implementation
- **goodsound**: some implementation of adaptive, original, enjoyable music, as well as satisfying sound effects
	- fully audio game?
	- could delineate the two ideas as well
